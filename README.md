This repository contains the scripts used for the analysis of the research paper titled "___Sustained improved survival of patients with metastatic melanoma after the introduction of anti-PD-1-based therapies___". 

The purpose of this project is to provide the scripts that analyze the data, generate key tables, and produce some of the main and supplementary figures mentioned in the paper.

## **Folder Structure** ##

* data: This folder contains all the data files used in the analysis. The relevant datasets and input files can be found here.
* docs: This folder contains additional documentation or supplementary materials related to the analysis. Any additional resources, such as data dictionaries or metadata, can be found here.
* output: The "outputs" folder contains the outputs generated by the scripts. It is organized into the following subfolders:
	* data_files: Intermediate or processed data files are stored here. These files are generated during the analysis and serve as inputs for subsequent steps.
	* figures: The figures generated during the analysis are saved in this subfolder. These figures include the main and supplementary figures mentioned in the paper created using the main scripts. Figures not included are created with different tools such as GraphPad as mentioned in the paper.
	* tables: The tables generated during analysis are saved in this subfolder. These tables include the main and supplementary tables mentioned in the paper created using the main scripts. Tables not included are created with different tools.
	* models: The models generated during analysis are saved in this folder
* scripts: The "scripts" folder contains the R scripts used for the analysis. It is organized into the following subfolders:
	* main: This subfolder contains the main R Markdown scripts that drive the analysis workflow. These scripts provide a step-by-step process for reproducing the analysis described in the paper.
	* functions: All custom R scripts with functions used in the analysis are stored in this subfolder. These functions are called by the main scripts for various calculations and data manipulations.
* session_info: The "session_info" folder holds the SessionInfo.txt files for each analysis. Each subfolder within "session_info" corresponds to a specific analysis, storing the respective SessionInfo.txt file.

*Note*: Data folders are empty since the data that support the findings of our study can be made available via application to the Danish Metastatic Melanoma Database steering committee. Further details are available from the corresponding author upon request

## **Instructions** ##

To reproduce the analysis conducted in the paper, please follow these steps:
1.	Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2.	Navigate to the "data" folder and ensure that all the required data files are present. These files serve as the input for the analysis scripts.
3.	Open the R Markdown scripts located in the "scripts/main" folder. These scripts outline the analysis workflow and provide instructions for reproducing the results.
4.	Ensure that the necessary R packages are installed and up to date. Refer to the SessionInfo.txt files within the respective "session_info" subfolders for the specific package versions used during each analysis.
5.	Set the working directory within each R Markdown script to the root folder of this project. This ensures that the relative paths to the data files and other resources are correctly resolved. Make sure that the default directory of all the chunks is set to the one also used in the console (change via global options). For knitting the .RMD file, change the root directory in the knit setup chunk at the top of the document.
6.	Execute the R Markdown scripts in the specified order, following the instructions and guidelines provided within each script.
7.	The outputs, including tables, figures and models, will be generated and stored in the "output" folder. Refer to the generated outputs for the corresponding results mentioned in the paper.

Please note that reproducing the analysis may require sufficient computational resources and dependencies. 

It is recommended to review the documentation and understand the workflow before running the scripts.
